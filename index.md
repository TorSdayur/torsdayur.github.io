## About Me
I'm an aspiring software developer and college senior studying Computer Science at CUNY Hunter College. I enjoy working on developing desktop and web applications (and the occasional CLI-based utility). When not studying for my courses or working on my projects, I enjoy spending time with my family and some scenic walking.
